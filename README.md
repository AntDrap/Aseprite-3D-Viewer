Aseprite 3D Viewer
Author: Anthony Drapeau

Summary:
Asperite 3D Viewer is a plugin for Aseprite designed to render OBJ files into animated wire frames.

Instructions:
1. Download the 3DViewer.lua file included in this repository
2. Add the file to the Aseprite plugins folder located in the Asperite roaming data folder ( path should look similar to "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Aseprite\scripts")
3. Open the plugin through the Aseprite edit tab Edit > Scripts > 3DViewer (if the plugin does not appear then rescan the scripts folder)
4. Import your obj file
5. Set the paremeters to your liking
6. Click run

Tips:
Before rendering a full animation I suggest rendering the first frame to ensure the model fits in your sprite's bounds
